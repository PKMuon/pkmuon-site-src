From April 19 to 22, 2024, the Workshop on High-Intensity and High-Precision Frontier Muon Physics (MIP 2024) was held at Siyuan Multifunctional Hall, School of Physics, Peking University. The conference chairs were Professor Qiang Li, Senior Engineer Qite Li, and Researcher Chen Zhou from School of Physics, Peking University. More than 180 participants from over 40 domestic and international institutions attended the conference. The topics of the workshop included research on future high-intensity accelerators, muon sources, precise measurements of the fundamental properties of muons, searches for rare muon decay processes, muon application technology, muon theory, future experiments, and muon colliders.

The conference opened on the morning of April 20th. Academician Yuanning Gao, Dean of the School of Physics at Peking University, delivered a welcome speech. Subsequently, experts and scholars from China, Japan, Thailand, the United Kingdom, Italy, Switzerland, and other countries gave 39 oral presentations and 26 poster presentations. At the closing ceremony, Professor Yajun Mao from School of Physics, Peking University and Professor Jingyu Tang from the University of Science and Technology of China presented awards to the winners of the poster competition and delivered closing remarks.

This conference was jointly organized by Peking University, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, University of Science and Technology of China, Institute of High Energy Physics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Institute of Theoretical Physics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Institute of Modern Physics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Nanjing University, Guangdong Provincial Laboratory of Advanced Energy Science and Technology, and Sun Yat-sen University. It was co-organized by the State Key Laboratory of Nuclear Physics and Technology at Peking University and supported by the Southern Nuclear Science Theoretical Research Center, the High Energy Physics Center of Peking University, and the State Key Laboratory of Nuclear Physics and Technology at Peking University. The conference announced that the workshops for the next two years will be hosted by Hunan University and the Institute of Modern Physics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, respectively. MIP is the most important series of conferences in the field of muon physics in China, aimed at promoting and strengthening the deep application and development of muon technology and devices in various related fields.
