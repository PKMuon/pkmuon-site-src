**P**robing sub-GeV dar**K** **M**atter **U**sing freely flying Lept**ON**s (**PKMUON**), a new method to detect sub-GeV dark matter at or below the MeV scale, through their scatterings from freely flying leptons and the resulting kinematic shifts. Specially, such an experiment can detect dark matter interacting solely with muons.
